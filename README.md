Hi guys, Synister here

This is now month 8 of fighting off the hacker that has taken over my home.
Ive lost all windows, and 3 pc's were damaged by kernel mods and no longer functional
I have been forced into linux and i must say i love it. though data recovery on windows was so much better.\

I could consistently recover hard drives and cycle them in and out as I attempted to clean his rootkits that no scan can register
ive lost a few hd now, and 15 years of my life. the hd are no longer recoverable in any way shape or form. even went so far as to
boot from the cache on the circuit board on the hd. nope. thousands of vids games pics files roms emulators gone now. 

I was able to break into his server when he was rootkitting and editing a fresh win install one day via com in devices
I cut and pasted a large chunk of his file system that included many links to his other victims as well as several several gb of d
Sadly my two 160gb baracuda hd which i used raid with somehow were drivelocked and the master key and user key are unknown
one of them i had saved the filesystem i cut out of his server to. :/ that one I was also able to code that day to be a consistent
link to his data server. when he noticed what i did he started to recall his system edits and filesystems from all hd on the pc
I wasnt going to lose a vital piece of information on finding out who he was. I shut my system down. I had installed on them hd
oem dell tpm and bitlocker security encryption. keys stored on another disk to accsess when i booted. I had planned this out.

Well, he mustve used a shell and bash script or term in the background or shadows and initiated my bios drivelocker option
when i went to start the 2 hd a few weeks later i was screwed. still am i think. I cannot find a way to get through drivelocker

on my laptop i still have a mass of his filesystems stored on my motherboard likely in my bios i dont know for sure. i cannot 
remove or edit. It also contains a registry that is a masterpiece. It allows for the use of linux osx and yes windows not
as separate filesystems, but as a coexisting combined super filesystem. I likely have every driver from most hp dell and mac in 
this 36mb partition (that expands to several several gb and writes to my hd or any iso download, it also links to his server
and codes everything when any and I mean any scan or search or even just touching the filesystem triggers the kit he has)

This guy is truely a genious. the things ive seen and what ive learned so far i couldve never imagined it being possible. 
who couldve guessed that stand alone non live or executable images like a picture could be a link to a server or have
a hidden code and filesystem hidden inside the layers. I have his tools, im learning so much. but there is so much i dont know.

ive used an overhaul code on my kali. At first it was able to keep him out where he couldnt accss my computer (not hooked up to 
any internet btw) remotely via uuid's or kernel pnp's stored within the registry that maps my pc reguardless. ill never
Understand how he accessed my pc's which had no internet access, or wireless cards as i removed them. simply accessed through
any known driver, device, chip, filesystem on the device.  

Well this rant is over, there is too much to say, and so much to explain i dont think i can within this readme. Any help would 
be
appreciated Thanks   Synister
